<!-- How to comment out -->

<!-- 
\svp{Emily and Reka, when we get into the editing stage, I've found this strategy to be useful: basically, when you add new text, use your color (feel free to change the command, for now yours are set to \er{$\backslash$er} and \rh{$\backslash$rh}.}
\svp{The way this usually works is that when e.g. I read over a document that Emily has recently edited, I will remove her flagged text to indicate that I've seen/accepted the changes (and vice versa - I'll edit text and highlight it with my color, and you can accept/modify and flag yours too) -- sometimes modifications happen first and then all of the color in a paragraph gets taken out once we've moved on.}
\svp{This not only leads to a nice rainbow effect, but you can quickly spot changes, too. If you're changing some slight phrasing/wording that doesn't change meaning, it's not necessary to highlight those changes - highlight content changes, not e.g. verb tenses.}
\svp{If something is a comment and has been addressed, comment it out initially and then delete the line after a couple of weeks.}

# Introduction and Background

+ Why Graphics? (communication to the public, technological advances, need for research on graphics)

\er{
Graphics are a useful tool for displaying and communicating information. 
Researchers include graphics to communicate their results in scientific publications and news sources rely on graphics to convey news stories to the public. 
During the onset of the novel coronavirus - covid19 - pandemic, we saw an influx of dashboards being developed to display case counts, transmission rates, and outbreak regions \citep{lisa_charlotte_2020}.
As a result, people began subscribing to news sources involved in graphically tracking the coronavirus (example John Burn-Murdoch Financial Times - CITE THIS) and gaining more exposure to the use of graphics. 
Many of these graphics helped guide decision makers to implement policies such as shut-downs or mandated mask wearing. 
Better software has meant easier and more flexible drawing, consistent themes, and higher standards.
Consequentially, we must develop a set of principles to help us actively choose which of many possible graphics to draw \citep{unwin_why_2020}.

As a consequence, principles are needed on how to decide which of many possible graphics to draw \citep{unwin_why_2020}.
}
\svp{
It's probably worth getting rid of passive voice here - we're making active decisions. Something like "Consequentially, we must actively choose which of many possible graphics to draw". I know technical writing classes often prefer passive voice to "take yourself out" of the science, but I think it de-emphasizes the conscious choices we make when we create charts.

+ Introduce Log Scales (what are they used for, where are they used (ecological data, covid, etc.))

<!--
\svp{
Start with why we'd choose a log scale: When faced with data which spans several orders of magnitude, we must decide whether to show the data on its original scale (compressing the smaller magnitudes into relatively little area) or to transform the scale and alter the contextual appearance of the data. You could even show a simple example, if you wanted to

\er{
When faced with data which spans several orders of magnitude, we must decide whether to show the data on its original scale (compressing the smaller magnitudes into relatively little area) or to transform the scale and alter the contextual appearance of the data. [EXAMPLE HERE]
One common graphical display choice is the use of log scales used to display data over several orders of magnitude within one graph. 
Logarithms convert multiplicative relationships to additive ones, providing an elegant way to span many orders of magnitude, to show elasticities and other proportional changes, and to linearize power laws \citep{menge_logarithmic_2018}. 
When presenting log-scaled data, it is possible to use either untransformed values (for example, values of 1, 10 and 100 are equally spaced along the axis) or log-transformed values (for example, 0, 1, and 2). 
We have recently experienced the benefits and pitfalls of using log-scales as covid-19 dashboards displayed case count data on both the log and linear scale \citep{wade_fagen_ulmschneider_2020}. 
INSERT BENEFITS AND PITFALLS OF LOG SCALES HERE. 
While COVID-19 is the most well known example, log-scales have been used to display data in ecological research, etc.

+ Previous exponential (log/linear scale) studies (literature review).

\er{
Previous research suggests our perception and mapping of numbers to a numberline proceeds logrithmically at first and transitions to linear later in development. 
The logarithmic mapping is more noticible in larger numbers as the transition to linear mapping occurs first for small numbers in young children and later for larger numbers \citep{varshney_why_2013, siegler_numerical_2017, dehaeneLogLinearDistinct2008}.
Early studies explored the estimation and prediction of exponential growth. 
Findings indicate that growth is underestimated when presented both numerically and graphically but that numerical estimation is more accurate than graphical estimation for exponential curves. 
While prior contextual knowledge or experience with exponential growth does not improve estimation, previous instruction on exponential growth reduces the underestimation by adjusting the initial starting value but not adjusting their perception of growth parameter
\citep{wagenaar_misperception_1975, jones_polynomial_1977}.
Estimation was shown to improve when subjects were presented with decreasing exponential functions \citep{timmers_inverse_1977}.
\cite{jones_polynomial_1977}, \cite{wagenaar_extrapolation_1978}, and \cite{jones_generalized_1979} propose competing polynomial models for the perception and extrapolation of exponential series.
We hypothesize that estimation is a two-stage process. First, we identify the type of curve and direction and then use that information for prediction \citep{best_perception_2007}.
}

\er{
This paper aims to investigate the use of log scales to display exponentially increasing data. We hypothesize log scales should make it much easier to estimate the growth paramter since we estimate slopes relatively accurately, resolving much of the difficulty with exponential estimation \citep{mosteller_eye_1981}.
In \cite{menge_logarithmic_2018}, ecologists were surveyed to determine how often ecologists encounter log-scaled data and how well ecologists understand log-scaled data. 
Participants were presented two relationships displayed on linear-linear scales, log-log scales with untransformed values, or log–log scales with log-transformed values. 
\cite{menge_logarithmic_2018} propose three types of misconceptions participants encountered when presented data on log-log scales: 'hand-hold fallacy', 'Zeno's zero fallacy', and 'watch out for curves fallacies'.

Three falacy's (explain further?)

Two relationships were shown on each graph, with distance from the edge of a habitat on the horizontal axis and population size.

whether each population was increasing or decreasing with distance
how steeply the rabbit population changed with distance compared to the chipmunk population.!!!!
Misconception: ‘hand-hold fallacy’
Climbing something steep is harder than climbing something gradual, but climbing something smooth (such as a window) is harder than climbing something with hand-holds (such as a ladder), regardless of slope.

population level at the edge of the habitat.
Misconception: ‘Zeno’s zero fallacy’
Zeno’s famous paradox states that a distance can never be reduced to zero because it must be halved infinitely many times and it is impossible to perform an infinite number of tasks.

the manner in which a population changes.
3 Misconceptions: ‘watch out for curves fallacies’
all lines in log–log space are also lines in linear–linear space
all lines in log–log space curve upwards in linear–linear space
curves in log–log space have similar curvature in linear–linear space

+ Visual Inference (what is it? how do we use it? etc.) *needs lots of work yet*

\er{Recent graphical experiments have utilized statistical lineups to quantify the perception of graphical design choices\citep{vanderplas_clusters_2017}. 
Statistical lineups provide an elegant way of combining perception and statistical signficiance by valdiating the findings from a graphical experiment \citep{buja_statistical_2009, wickham2010graphical, hofmann_graphical_2012, majumder_validation_2013, vanderplas_clusters_2017}.
'Lineups' are named after the 'police lineup' of criminal investigations where witnesses are asked to identify the criminal from a set of individuals. 
Similarly, a statistical lineup is a plot consisting of smaller panels of plots in which the viewer is asked to identify the plot of the real data from among a set of decoys, the null plots. 
A statistical lineup typically consists of 20 panels - 1 target panel and 19 null panels (INSERT EXAMPLE). 
If the viewer can identify the target panel embeded within the set of null panels, this suggests that the real data is interesting or has unqiue properties.
Crowd sourcing websites such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, Reddit, and Proflic allow us to collect responses from multiple viewers.
\cite{vanderplas_statistical_nodate} provides an approach for calculating visual p-values utilizing a 'rorschach' lineup which consists soley of null panels.

+ What is new in this paper.

\er{
In this paper, we use statistical lineups to test human subjects ability to differentiate between increasing exponential data with differing growth rates displayed on both the linear scale and log scale.
}

# Data Generation

\er{
The most common type of lineup used in graphical experiments is a standard lineup containing one "target" dataset embeded within a set of null datasets. 
One way to generate the null datasets when working with real data is through the use of permutation. In this study, the target dataset was generated by model A while the null datasets were generated by model B.

## Task Description

\er{Participants were shown a series of twelve test lineup plots and asked to identify the plot that was different. 
On each plot, participants were asked to justify their choice and provide their level of confidence in their choice.
The goal of this experimental task is to test an individuals ability to perceptually differentiate exponentially increasing data with differing rates of change on both the linear and log scale. 
In \cite{best_perception_2007}, the authors expored whether descrimination between curve types is possible. 
They found that accuracy higher when nonlinear trends presented (e.g. it’s hard to say something is linear, but easy to say that it isn’t) and that accuracy higher with low additive variability.

+ You draw it

    + \er{\citep{mosteller_eye_1981} designed and carried out an empirical investigation to explore properties of lines fitted by eye. The researchers found that students tended to fit the slope of the first principal component or major axis (the line that minimizes the sum of squares of perpendicular rather than vertical distances) and that students who gave steep slopes for one data set also tended to give steep slopes on the others. Interestingly, the individual-to-individual variability in slope and in intercept was near the standard error provided by least squares for the four data sets.}
    + \er{The goal of this task is to test an individuals ability to make predictions for exponentially increasing data.}
    + \er{Previous literature suggests that we tend to underestimate predictions of exponentially increasing data.\citep{jones_generalized_1979, jones_polynomial_1977, wagenaar_extrapolation_1978}}
    + \er{The idea for this task was inspired by the New York Times "You Draw It" page which is fun to check out.}

+ Estimation

    + \er{This tests an individuals ability to translate a graph of exponentially increasing data into real value quantities. We then ask individuals to extend their estimates by making comparisons across levels of the independent variable.}
    + \er{\citep{friel_making_2001} emphasize the importance of graph comprehension proposing that the graph construction plays a role in the ability to read and interpret graphs.}
