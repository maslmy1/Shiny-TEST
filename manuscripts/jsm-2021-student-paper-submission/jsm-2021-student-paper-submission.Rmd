  Log scales are often used to display data over several orders of magnitude within one graph. During the COVID pandemic, weâ€™ve seen both the benefits and the pitfalls of using log scales to display data. This paper aims to...

<!-- How to comment out -->

\svp{Emily and Reka, when we get into the editing stage, I've found this strategy to be useful: basically, when you add new text, use your color (feel free to change the command, for now yours are set to \er{$\backslash$er} and \rh{$\backslash$rh}.}
\svp{The way this usually works is that when e.g. I read over a document that Emily has recently edited, I will remove her flagged text to indicate that I've seen/accepted the changes (and vice versa - I'll edit text and highlight it with my color, and you can accept/modify and flag yours too) -- sometimes modifications happen first and then all of the color in a paragraph gets taken out once we've moved on.}
\svp{This not only leads to a nice rainbow effect, but you can quickly spot changes, too. If you're changing some slight phrasing/wording that doesn't change meaning, it's not necessary to highlight those changes - highlight content changes, not e.g. verb tenses.}
\svp{If something is a comment and has been addressed, comment it out initially and then delete the line after a couple of weeks.}
