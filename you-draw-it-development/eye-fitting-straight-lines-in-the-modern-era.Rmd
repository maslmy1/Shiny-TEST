### Summary of [Eye Fitting Straight Lines](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1981.10479335)

-   Mosteller, F., Siegel, A. F., Trapido, E., & Youtz, C. (1981). Eye fitting straight lines. The American Statistician, 35(3), 150-152.

### Method/Procedure

-   Method involves maneuvering a string, black thread, or ruler until the fit seems satisfactory, and then drawing the line.

-   Students fitted lines by eye to four sets of points (S, F, V, N).

-   Sample: graduate students and post doc students in introductory biostatistics (most had not studied statistics before).

    -   laid out 175 packets, collected 153 at the end of the hour.
    -   Each student was given the same set of four scatter diagrams and an 8.5 x 11 inch transparency with a straight line etched completely across the middle.

### Parameters

## Experimental Design

Latin square with packets stapeled in four different orders:

-   SNFV
-   NSVF
-   FVSN
-   VFNS

Distributed systematically in sequence so that students sitting side by side had different kinds of packets.

### Results

-   Students tended to fit the slope of the first principal component or major axis (the line that minimizes the sum of squares of perpendicular rather than vertical distances).
-   Students had a slight tendency to choose consistently either steeper or shallower slopes for all sets of data.
-   Individual-to-individual variability in slope and in intercept was near the standard error provided by least squares for the four data sets *(no theory ecourages us to beleive in such relations)*.
-   Found no trend in the differences due to order.

### Considerations for Eye Fitting Straight Lines in the Modern Era

-   You Draw It does not restrict participants to a straight line.
-   Does order matter?
