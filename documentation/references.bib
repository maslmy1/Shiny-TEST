	abstract = {The complexity of linear mixed-effects (LME) models means that traditional diagnostics are rendered less effective. This is due to a breakdown of asymptotic results, boundary issues, and visible patterns in residual plots that are introduced by the model fitting process. Some of these issues are well known and adjustments have been proposed. Working with LME models typically requires that the analyst keeps track of all the special circumstances that may arise. In this article, we illustrate a simpler but generally applicable approach to diagnosing LME models. We explain how to use new visual inference methods for these purposes. The approach provides a unified framework for diagnosing LME fits and for model selection. We illustrate the use of this approach on several commonly available datasets. A large-scale Amazon Turk study was used to validate the methods. R code is provided for the analyses. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {In statistical modeling, we strive to specify models that resemble data collected in studies or observed from processes. Consequently, distributional specification and parameter estimation are central to parametric models. Graphical procedures, such as the quantile–quantile (Q–Q) plot, are arguably the most widely used method of distributional assessment, though critics find their interpretation to be overly subjective. Formal goodness of fit tests are available and are quite powerful, but only indicate whether there is a lack of fit, not why there is lack of fit. In this article, we explore the use of the lineup protocol to inject rigor into graphical distributional assessment and compare its power to that of formal distributional tests. We find that lineup tests are considerably more powerful than traditional tests of normality. A further investigation into the design of Q–Q plots shows that de-trended Q–Q plots are more powerful than the standard approach as long as the plot preserves distances in x and y to be the same. While we focus on diagnosing nonnormality, our approach is general and can be directly extended to the assessment of other distributions.},

Ideally, when the data changes, the visualization changes in perceptible ways. This relation breaks down when there is a mismatch between the encoding and the character of the dataset being viewed. Unfortunately, visualizations are often designed and evaluated without fully exploring how they will respond to a wide variety of datasets. We explore the use of an image similarity measure, the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM), for testing the discriminability of a data visualization across a variety of datasets. MS-SSIM is able to capture the similarity of two visualizations across multiple scales, including low level granular changes and high level patterns. Signiﬁcant data changes that are not captured by the MS-SSIM indicate visualizations of low discriminability and effectiveness. The measure’s utility is demonstrated with two empirical studies. In the ﬁrst, we compare human similarity judgments and MS-SSIM scores for a collection of scatterplots. In the second, we compute the discriminability values for a set of basic visualizations and compare them with empirical measurements of effectiveness. In both cases, the analyses show that the computational measure is able to approximate empirical results. Our approach can be used to rank competing encodings on their discriminability and to aid in selecting visualizations for a particular type of data distribution.},

	abstract = {Visual statistical inference is a way to determine signiﬁcance of patterns found while exploring data. It is dependent on the evaluation of a lineup, of a data plot among a sample of null plots, by human observers. Each individual is different in their cognitive psychology and judiciousness, which can affect the visual inference. The usual way to estimate the effectiveness of a statistical test is its power. The estimate of power of a lineup can be controlled by combining evaluations from multiple observers. Factors that may also affect the power of visual inference are the observers’ demographics, visual skills, and experience, the sample of null plots taken from the null distribution, the position of the data plot in the lineup, and the signal strength in the data. This paper examines these factors. Results from multiple visual inference studies using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk are examined to provide an assessment of these. The experiments suggest that individual skills vary substantially, but demographics do not have a huge effect on performance. There is evidence that a learning effect exists but only in that observers get faster with repeated evaluations, but not more often correct. The placement of data plot in the lineup does not affect the inference.},

This visual inspection is particularly important in exploratory data analysis, where analysts can use visualizations such as histograms and dot plots to identify data quality issues. Yet, these visualizations are driven by parameters such as histogram bin size or mark opacity that have a great deal of impact on the ﬁnal visual appearance of the chart, but are rarely optimized to make important features visible. In this paper, we show that data ﬂaws have varying impact on the visual features of visualizations, and that the adversarial or merely uncritical setting of design parameters of visualizations can obscure the visual signatures of these ﬂaws. Drawing on the framework of Algebraic Visualization Design, we present the results of a crowdsourced study showing that common visualization types can appear to reasonably summarize distributional data while hiding large and important ﬂaws such as missing data and extraneous modes. We make use of these results to propose additional best practices for visualizations of distributions for data quality tasks.},

However, in some applications, this assumption may be inappropriate. To this end, this paper proposes a novel LMM by assuming that the random effects follow an unknown distribution, and the within-individual errors associated with the transformed responses are Gaussian. A semiparametric Bayesian approach is developed to make Bayesian inference on the novel LMM by using the truncated centered Dirichlet Process prior to approximate the unknown distribution of the random effects and using Bayesian P-splines to approximate the transformation function, and combining the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. A Bayesian local influence analysis method is developed to assess the effect of minor perturbations. Simulation studies and an example are used to illustrate the proposed methodologies.},

	abstract = {As useful multivariate techniques, structural equation models have attracted signiﬁcant attention from various ﬁelds. Most existing statistical methods and software for analyzing structural equation models have been developed based on the assumption that the response variables are normally distributed. Several recently developed methods can partially address violations of this assumption, but still encounter difﬁculties in analyzing highly nonnormal data. Moreover, the presence of missing data is a practical issue in substantive research. Simply ignoring missing data or improperly treating nonignorable missingness as ignorable could seriously distort statistical inﬂuence results. The main objective of this article is to develop a Bayesian approach for analyzing transformation structural equation models with highly nonnormal and missing data. Different types of missingness are discussed and selected via the deviance information criterion. The empirical performance of our method is examined via simulation studies. Application to a study concerning people’s job satisfaction, home life, and work attitude is presented.},

	abstract = {Collaborative prediction involves ﬁlling in missing entries of a useritem matrix to predict preferences of users based on their observed preferences. Most of existing models assume that the data is missing at random (MAR), which is often violated in recommender systems in practice. Incorrect assumption on missing data ignores the missing data mechanism, leading to biased inferences and prediction. In this paper we present a Bayesian binomial mixture model for collaborative prediction, where the generative process for data and missing data mechanism are jointly modeled to handle nonrandom missing data. Missing data mechanism is modeled by three factors, each of which is related to users, items, and rating values. Each factor is modeled by Bernoulli random variable, and the observation of rating value is determined by the Boolean OR operation of three binary variables. We develop computationallyefﬁcient variational inference algorithms, where variational parameters have closed-form update rules and the computational complexity depends on the number of observed ratings, instead of the size of the rating data matrix. We also discuss implementation issues on hyperparameter tuning and estimation based on empirical Bayes. Experiments on Yahoo! Music and MovieLens datasets conﬁrm the useful behavior of our model by demonstrating that: (1) it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in yielding higher predictive performance; (2) it ﬁnds meaningful solutions instead of undesirable boundary solutions; (3) it provides rating trend analysis on why ratings are observed.},

However, a more holistic understanding of academic success can be achieved by examining the noncognitive profiles of students and their relationship with academic outcomes. In the present study, we used latent profile analysis to explore the noncognitive profiles of 5,120 college students. To better understand the nature of the profiles, the effect of covariates on class membership was examined. Results indicated that there were 6 latent profiles underlying the noncognitive skills of college students in our sample and that profile membership was associated with different collegiate grade point average levels. Our results have practical implications for the development of interventions intended to improve academic performance, which may be customized toward the specific needs of students presenting with diverse profiles.},

Such an understanding is the basis for accurately predicting at-risk students and appropriately intervening to retain them. In this study, using ﬁve years of institutional data along with several data mining techniques (both individuals as well as ensembles), we developed analytical models to predict and to explain the reasons behind freshmen student attrition. The comparative analyses results showed that the ensembles performed better than individual models, while the balanced dataset produced better prediction results than the unbalanced dataset.

We aim at early detection of potential failure using student data available at registration, i.e. school records and environmental factors, with a view to timely and eﬃcient remediation and/or study reorientation. We adapt three data mining methods, namely random forest, logistic regression and artiﬁcial neural network algorithms. We design algorithms to increase the accuracy of the prediction when some classes are of major interest. These algorithms are context independent and can be used in different ﬁelds. Real data pertaining to undergraduates at the University of Liège (Belgium), illustrates our methodology.},

However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a randomly selected training set classiﬁed in advance. In many settings, we also have the option of using pool-based active learning. Instead of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them. We introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a version space. We present experimental results showing that employing our active learning method can signiﬁcantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.},

	abstract = {Rapid changes in Earth’s cryosphere caused by human activity can lead to signiﬁcant environmental impacts. Computer models provide a useful tool for understanding the behavior and projecting the future of Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets. However, these models are typically subject to large parametric uncertainties due to poorly constrained model input parameters that govern the behavior of simulated ice sheets. Computer model calibration provides a formal statistical framework to infer parameters using observational data, and to quantify the uncertainty in projections due to the uncertainty in these parameters. Calibration of ice sheet models is often challenging because the relevant model output and observational data take the form of semicontinuous spatial data, with a point mass at zero and a right-skewed continuous distribution for positive values. Current calibration approaches cannot handle such data. Here we introduce a hierarchical latent variable model that handles binary spatial patterns and positive continuous spatial patterns as separate components. To overcome challenges due to high-dimensionality we use likelihood-based generalized principal component analysis to impose low-dimensional structures on the latent variables for spatial dependence. We apply our methodology to calibrate a physical model for the Antarctic ice sheet and demonstrate that we can overcome the aforementioned modeling and computational challenges. As a result of our calibration, we obtain improved future ice-volume change projections.},

	abstract = {Despite more than two decades of continuous development learning from imbalanced data is still a focus of intense research. Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception. With the expansion of machine learning and data mining, combined with the arrival of big data era, we have gained a deeper insight into the nature of imbalanced learning, while at the same time facing new emerging challenges. Data-level and algorithm-level methods are constantly being improved and hybrid approaches gain increasing popularity. Recent trends focus on analyzing not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difﬁculties embedded in the nature of data. New real-life problems motivate researchers to focus on computationally efﬁcient, adaptive and real-time methods. This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the ﬁeld of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identiﬁed, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classiﬁcation, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision. This paper provides a discussion and suggestions concerning lines of future research for each of them.},

Tens of millions of people each year suffer from depression and only a fraction receives adequate treatment. We explore the potential to use social media to detect and diagnose major depressive disorder in individuals. We first employ crowdsourcing to compile a set of Twitter users who report being diagnosed with clinical depression, based on a standard psychometric instrument. Through their social media postings over a year preceding the onset of depression, we measure behavioral attributes relating to social engagement, emotion, language and linguistic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant medications. We leverage these behavioral cues, to build a statistical classifier that provides estimates of the risk of depression, before the reported onset. We find that social media contains useful signals for characterizing the onset of depression in individuals, as measured through decrease in social activity, raised negative affect, highly clustered egonetworks, heightened relational and medicinal concerns, and greater expression of religious involvement. We believe our findings and methods may be useful in developing tools for identifying the onset of major depression, for use by healthcare agencies; or on behalf of individuals, enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about their mental health.},

The youth suicide rates in predominantly indigenous small, rural, and remote Northern communities are unacceptably high. This health disparity, however, is fairly recent, occurring over the last 50 to 100 years as communities experienced forced social, economic, and political change and intergenerational trauma. These conditions increase suicide risk and can reduce people’s access to shared protective factors and processes. In this context, it is imperative that suicide prevention includes—at its heart—decolonization, while also utilizing the “best practices” from research to effectively address the issue from multiple levels. This article describes such an approach: Promoting Community Conversations About Research to End Suicide (PC CARES). PC CARES uses popular education strategies to build a “community of practice” among local and regional service providers, friends, and families that fosters personal and collective learning about suicide prevention in order to spur practical action on multiple levels to prevent suicide and promote health. This article will discuss the theoretical underpinnings of the community intervention and describe the form that PC CARES takes to structure ongoing dialogue, learning, solidarity, and multilevel mobilization for suicide prevention.},

statistician or methodologist with another professional for devising solutions to
research problems. An in-depth, interview qualitative approach was taken to
answer the research question of what makes a good research consultant. The
authors interviewed four faculty members in the field of statistics and research
methods and two experienced graduate student consultants. In-depth, face-toface interviews revealed common themes regarding consultancy skills,
resourcefulness, communication and interpersonal skills. The participants
discussed how to improve consulting sessions and deal with clients with
different statistics levels and backgrounds. Participants felt there was no
difference in how they approached a qualitative vs. quantitative consulting
session. Finally, all the participants stated that the training of graduate student
consultants can be improved by project-based coursework. Keywords:

These compounds are predominantly formed in glandular trichomes, known as ‘lupulin glands’. In this study, we investigated chemical and morphological characteristics of lupulin glands by microscopy and HPLC
analyses. Even though no significant correlations were found between lupulin glands and hop cones for contents of alpha and beta bitter acids, polyphenols, all ratios between individual metabolites (alpha/beta acids, X/alpha acids, X/DMX) were highly and significantly correlated. The average number of lupulin glands on bract/bracteole ranged from 115 to 713 with 28.5\% of variability. Linear regression analyses confirmed that total volume of lupulin glands and total lupulin glands area on bract/bracteole surface
highly correlated with contents of bitter acids and polyphenols in hop cone. Therefore, lupulin glands are unique and exclusive organs responsible for contents of bitter acids and polyphenols in hop cone.},

Hops Lupulin Glands (LG):

3 natural products (metabolites?), vary for each hop variety

alpha bitter acits
beta bitter acids
essential oils


Glandular trichomes?

most abundant in inflorescence, but also present on vegetable leaves
two types:

peltate
bulbous




Terpenophenolics?

accumlate as cones increase in length, which corresponds to the elongation of bracts \& bracteoles


What are PIBP, PMBP, \& PIVP? Precursors?



Results:

Close correlations between the avg volume \& number of lupulin glands \& the content of alpha acids, respectively
no significant correlations were found between lupulin glands and hop cones for contents of individual metabolites
significant correlation on ratios (table 1)
alpha and beta acids

+ correlation with hop cones
- correlation with LG
(Do we care about hop vs LG?)


Regression between volume of LG and area of Hop Cones
Was cultivar ignored for correlations and regression?



Considerations:

What is your experimental unit (e.u.)? Hop cone? plant? cultivar?
What is your sampling unit (s.u.)? hop cone? LG?
How to identify cultivars?
What variables do you need to measure?

what are you measuring them on? Hope cone? bract/bracteole? LG?
alpha, beta, area, volume?
How do you measure these?

HPLC?
What are the units of measurement?
Can you avoid / minimize measurement errors?

Time of harvest? alpha volume increases with maturity.






Weather conditions:

do you plan to do this over multiple years?
alpha and beta acids are sensitive.
ratios of cohum/hum + adhum and colup/lupu + adlup are very stable

what are these?




Necessary to charactarize hop cones \& lupulin glands from the same samples
Measure size of LG.

For the case of equal sample sizes we derive the exact null distribution by counting lattice paths conﬁned to stay in the scaled alcove Ar of the afﬁne Weyl group Ar−1. This is done using a generalization of the classical reﬂection principle. By a standard diffusion scaling we derive also the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic in terms of a multivariate Dirichlet series. When the sample sizes are not equal the reﬂection principle no longer works, but we are able to establish a weak convergence result even in this case showing that by a proper rescaling a test statistic based on a linear transformation of the circular differences of the empirical distribution functions has the same asymptotic distribution as the test statistic in the case of equal sample sizes.},

	abstract = {Active learning strategies have been increasingly adopted in higher education across many science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. Audience response systems, or clickers, are useful tools that allow instructors to incorporate active learning into large-enrollment courses. Clickers engage students during class and provide real-time feedback that can allow both students and the instructor to identify and correct misconceptions. Many instructors that implement clickers also implement peer instruction, where students vote individually, discuss the question with their peers, and then revote. While this strategy has been shown to improve conceptual understanding, the eﬀects of speciﬁc factors, such as question format and student performance level, on learning gains remains unclear. We designed a study in which students in an introductory biology course engaged in clickers with peer discussion during class. We incorporated a treatment in which one section of the course answered a given clicker question in a multiple-choice (MC) format and another section of the same course answered the same question in a multiple-true-false (MTF) format. Students subsequently answered an isomorphic exam question 1–3 weeks later. We observed that both clicker question formats had similar effects on later exam performance. While clickers had an overall positive eﬀect on student exam performance, we found that this eﬀect was signiﬁcantly greater in higher-performing students, with lower-performing students showing little-to-no beneﬁt. We also found that the initial response rates within peer discussion groups inﬂuenced whether students changed to the correct answer. These ﬁndings demonstrate that students interact with and beneﬁt from clicker questions in diﬀerent ways and highlights the importance of considering how diﬀerent students might be aﬀected by active learning strategies.},

available for some of its strains, is active in a population. We solved for four different
equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability. The
reproduction number was also determined for the epidemiological model and found to

	abstract = {Examining data using graphical tools, such as histograms, quantile plots, scatterplots and the like, is a necessary part of any serious analysis effort. With the advent of inexpensive graphics-capable desktop computing, such tools are generally available. But the use of computers enables more than simply reproducing static plots on a display; it allows users to interact with plots, changing parameters, querying, zooming and linking plots together so that interesting features of one plot can be seen in the light of the others. In this paper we discuss the core features of interactive graphics, investigate how familiar plots can be made interactive and show examples of interactive graphics for general and specific data analysis.},

The data analyst takes an action through manual manipulation of an input device and something happens in real time on the screen. These computing capabilities provide a new medium for the invention of graphical methods for data analysis. A collection of such methods-identification, deletion, linking, brushing, scaling, rotation, and dynamic parameter control-is reviewed. Those who develop dynamic methods must deal with a number of computer hardware and software issues, because for a dynamic method to work there must be a sufficiently fast flow of information along the channel that starts with the analyst's input and ends with the changed graph. Furthermore, for a dynamic method to be useful, the visual and manual tasks must be easy to perform. Several computing issues dealing with speed and ease of usesystem bandwidth, input and output devices, low-level algorithms, device independent graphics, and data analysis environments-are reviewed.},

The user's interactions needs to be propagated through these modules and reflected in the output representation at a fast pace. Each individual module may be easy to develop and manage, but the dependency structure can be quite challenging. The MVC (Model/View/Controller) pattern is an attempt to solve the problem by separating the user's interaction from the representation of the data. In this paper we discuss the paradigm of reactive programming in the framework of the MVC architecture and show its applicability to interactive graphics. Under this paradigm, developers benefit from the separation of user interaction from the graphical representation, which makes it easier for users and developers to extend interactive applications. We show the central role of reactive data objects in an interactive graphics system, implemented as the R package cranvas, which is freely available on GitHub and the main developers include the authors of this paper.

	abstract = {The need for interpretable and accountable intelligent systems grows along with the prevalence of artificial intelligence applications used in everyday life. Explainable intelligent systems are designed to self-explain the reasoning behind system decisions and predictions, and researchers from different disciplines work together to define, design, and evaluate interpretable systems. However, scholars from different disciplines focus on different objectives and fairly independent topics of interpretable machine learning research, which poses challenges for identifying appropriate design and evaluation methodology and consolidating knowledge across efforts. To this end, this paper presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines. Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research, after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a categorization of interpretable machine learning design goals and evaluation methods to show a mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further, we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.},

In practice, interpretability is a desirable property of classiﬁcation models (classiﬁers) in critical areas, such as security, medicine, and ﬁnance. For instance, a quantitative trader may prefer a more interpretable model with less expected return due to its predictability and low risk. Unfortunately, the best-performing classiﬁers in many applications (e.g., deep neural networks) are complex machines whose predictions are difﬁcult to explain. Thus, there is a growing interest in using visualization to understand, diagnose and explain intelligent systems in both academia and in industry. Many challenges need to be addressed in the formalization of explainability, and the design principles and evaluation of explainable intelligent systems.},

This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness sometimes at the cost of scarifying accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a speciﬁc problem and, as a consequence, delineating explicitly or implicitly its own deﬁnition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this paper is to provide a classiﬁcation of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem deﬁnition, a black box type, and a desired explanation this survey should help the researcher to ﬁnd the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classiﬁcation of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.},

This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufﬁcient. Finally, based on our survey, we conclude with suggested future research directions for explanatory artiﬁcial intelligence.},

If cognitive processes parallel perceptual processes, then fundamental psychophysical laws should hold for each. To test this, we analyzed both behavioral and neuronal representations of numerosity in the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys. The data were best described by a nonlinearly compressed scaling of numerical information, as postulated by the Weber-Fechner law or Stevens’ law for psychophysical/sensory magnitudes. This nonlinear compression was observed on the neural level during the acquisition phase of the task and maintained through the memory phase with no further compression. These results suggest that certain cognitive and perceptual/sensory representations share the same fundamental mechanisms and neural coding schemes.},

Therefore, if a continuumbetween perceptual and cognitive processes exists, numerical representations should also be represented on a nonlinear, compressed “number scale.”
To reach equal discriminability for numerosities smaller and larger than the sample numerosity, the numerical distance between sample and test must be larger if the test numerosity is higher than the sample. This effect should become even more obvious for larger magnitudes.

nonlinearly compressed scaling


the idea is that compression enlarges the coding space, thus increasing the dynamic range of perception and firing neurons.

	abstract = {Research on the role of diet on gut and systemic health has led to considerable interest toward identifying novel therapeutic modulators of the gut microbiome, including the use of prebiotics and probiotics. However, various host responses have often been reported among many clinical trials. This is in part due to competitive exclusion as a result of the absence of ecological niches as well as hostmediated constraints via colonization resistance. In this research, we developed a novel in vitro enrichment (IVE) method for isolating autochthonous strains that can function as synergistic synbiotics and overcome these constraints. The method relied on stepwise in vitro fecal fermentations to enrich for and isolate Biﬁdobacterium strains that ferment the prebiotic xylooligosaccharide (XOS). We subsequently isolated Biﬁdobacterium longum subsp. longum CR15 and then tested its establishment in 20 unique fecal samples with or without XOS. The strain was established in up to 18 samples but only in the presence of XOS. Our ﬁndings revealed that the IVE method is suitable for isolating potential synergistic probiotic strains that possess the genetic and biochemical ability to ferment speciﬁc prebiotic substrates. The IVE method can be used as an initial high-throughput screen for probiotic selection and isolation prior to further characterization and in vivo tests.},

Computer game technology offers the opportunity to experience how often an event occurs, rather than simply read about its frequency. Objective. To assess effects of interactive graphics on risk perceptions and decisions. Design. Electronic questionnaire. Participants and setting. Respondents (n = 165) recruited online or at an urban hospital. Intervention. Health risks were illustrated by either static graphics or interactive game-like graphics. The interactive search graphic was a grid of squares, which, when clicked, revealed stick figures underneath. Respondents had to click until they found a figure affected by the disease. Measurements. Risk feelings, risk estimates, intention to take preventive action. Results. Different graphics did not affect mean risk estimates, risk feelings, or intention. Low-numeracy participants reported significantly higher risk feelings than high-numeracy ones except with the interactive search graphic. Unexpectedly, respondents reported stronger intentions to take preventive action when the intention question followed questions about efficacy and disease severity than when it followed perceived risk questions (65\% v. 34\%; P {\textless} 0.001). When respondents reported risk feelings immediately after using the search graphic, the interaction affected perceived risk (the longer the search to find affected stick figures, the higher the risk feeling: r = 0.57; P = 0.009). Limitations. The authors used hypothetical decisions. Conclusions. A game-like graphic that allowed consumers to search for stick figures affected by disease had no main effect on risk perception but reduced differences based on numeracy. In one condition, the game-like graphic increased concern about rare risks. Intentions for preventive action were stronger with a question order that focused first on efficacy and disease severity than with one that focused first on perceived risk.

A random sample of women (N = 266) completed a questionnaire assessing numeracy and risk perception of prenatal test results and results of colon cancer screening tests. The authors examined the relationships between risk level (high v. low) and format of risk presentation (ratio, pictogram, or Paling Perspective Scale) and whether these relationships differed based on the numeracy skills of the participant.

Results. The authors identified a significant (P {\textless} 0.001) 3-way interaction between format, risk level, and numeracy: high-numerate participants in the low-risk group perceived the test results as less risky compared with participants in the high-risk group (P {\textless} 0.001) with the Paling Perspective Scale but not with the other formats. For lownumerate participants, they did not observe differences between low- and high-risk scenarios for any of the 3 formats. The results were similar for the Down syndrome and colon cancer scenarios. Overall, the pictogram resulted in significantly lower risk ratings compared with the Paling Perspective Scale and the ratio with numerator 1 (P {\textless} 0.001).

Conclusion. Different communication formats may produce different risk perceptions, but the effect is qualified by patients’ numeracy skills.

Paling Perspective Scale is a graphical representation that depicts risks covering different orders of magnitude on a logarithmic scale.

The Paling Perspective Scale uses a logarithmic scale to depict comparative risk information. Our previous study indicated that participants did not use the logarithmic scale to rate the risk.15We obtained similar resultswhenwe compared the Paling Perspective Scale with a list providing comparative risk information. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the logarithmic scale is the reason why low-numerate individuals did not differentiate between high- and low-risk levels. In addition, the magnifier scale employing a logarithmic scale23 was found to be used by low-numerate individuals in the same way as by high-numerate individuals. Further research evaluating risk communication formats that provide comparative information as a table is needed to qualify this conclusion.


Compare high- and low-numerate individuals.

	abstract = {Background. Quantitative risk information plays an important role in decision making about health. This study focuses on commonly used numerical and graphical formats and examines their effect on perception of different likelihoods and choice preferences. Methods. An experimental study was conducted with 192 participants, who evaluated 2 sets of 4 lotteries. Numerical formats to describe likelihood varied systematically between participants (X\%, X-in-100, or 1-in-X). The effect of  graphic formats (bar charts, icon charts) was assessed as a withinsubjects factor. Dependent measures included perceived likelihood, choice preferences about participating in the lottery, and processing times. Results. Numerical likelihoods presented as 1-in-X were processed fastest and were perceived as conveying larger likelihoods than the X-in-100 and percentages formats (mean response times in seconds: 5.65 v. 7.31 and 6.50; mean rating on a 1–9 scale: 4.38 v. 3.30 and 3.31, respectively). The 1-in-X format also evoked a stronger willingness to participate in a lottery than the 2 other numerical formats. The effect of adding graphs on perceived likelihood was moderated by numerical aptitude. Graphs reduced ratings of perceived likelihood of participants with lower numeracy, while there was no overall effect for participants with higher numeracy. Conclusion. Perception of likelihood differs significantly depending on the numerical format used. The 1-in-X format yields higher perceived likelihoods and it appears to be the easiest format to interpret. Graphs primarily affect perception of likelihood of people with lower numerical aptitude. These effects should be taken into account when discussing medical risks with patients.

The logarithm is an extremely powerful and useful tool for graphical data presentation. One reason is that logarithms tum ratios into differences , and for many sets of data, it is natural to think in terms of ratios.

Assume t/u = v/w

Then on a graph involving these four numbers on the original scale, it is difficult to visually detect the equality of the ratios withoutreading numerical values from the scale and doing mental arithmetic.
If we plot logarithms we have a much better chance of detecting equality, since it is now a matter of perceiving that the distance along the log scale of log (t) to log (u) is equal to the distance from log (v) to log (w); thisis a reasonable graphical perceptual chore.




Resolution

Data that are amounts or counts are often very skewed to the right; on graphs of such data, there are a few large values that take up most of the scale and the majority of the points are squashed into a small region of the scale with no resolution.


Log base 2 and log base e should always be considered.
natural logarithms have a wonderful property

Suppose t and u are positive numbers and tlv =1 + r, where r is between - .25 and .25. Then to a good approximation, log (ti v) is r . For r positive the largest error in this range is for r = .25: log (I + .25) = .223. For r negative the largest error in this range is for r = - .25: log(1 - .25) = - .287. Thus on a natural log plot, if two values-log (t) and log (u)-differ by an amount log (t) - log (u) = r that is between - .25 and .25, then we know tis approximately 100,\% larger than u if r is positive and 100,\% smaller if r is negative.


Multibased logging is important for presenting data on log scales; using base 2 or base e in place of base IO can frequently enhance understanding of the variation in the data.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, the tool most commonly used to convey statistical information about the spread of the virus has been time-series graphs about the cumulative number of cases. When drawing such graphs, analysts have to make design decisions which can have dramatic effects on citizens’ interpretations. Plotting the COVID-19 progression on a linear scale highlights an exponential “explosion” in the number of cases, whereas plotting the number of cases on a logarithmic scale produces a line with a modest-looking slope. Even if the two graphs display the exact same information, differences in visual design may lead people to different substantive conclusions. In this study, we measure the causal effect of different visualization design choices on Canadians’ views about the crisis. We report results from a survey experiment conducted in April 2020 with a sample of 2500 respondents. We find that no matter how the information is presented, Canadians are united in supporting drastic confinement measures and in accepting that these measures will not be removed soon.},

Is this mapping a cultural invention or a universal intuition shared by all humans regardless of culture and education? We probed number-space mappings in the Mundurucu, an Amazonian indigene group with a reduced numerical lexicon and little or no formal education. At all ages, the Mundurucu mapped symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers onto a logarithmic scale, whereas Western adults used linear mapping with small or symbolic numbers and logarithmic mapping when numbers were presented nonsymbolically under conditions that discouraged counting. This indicates that the mapping of numbers onto space is a universal intuition and that this initial intuition of number is logarithmic. The concept of a linear number line appears to be a cultural invention that fails to develop in the absence of formal education.
Adults from an Amazonian tribe view numbers as a logarithmic progression (e.g., 10 is halfway to 100), suggesting that our linear view of numbers is culturally learned.

However, users’ interactions with their internal representations, including their expectations about data, are also critical for a visualization to support learning. We present multiple graphically-based techniques for eliciting and incorporating a user’s prior knowledge about data into visualization interaction. We use controlled experiments to evaluate how graphically eliciting forms of prior knowledge and presenting feedback on the gap between prior knowledge and the observed data impacts a user’s ability to recall and understand the data. We ﬁnd that participants who are prompted to reﬂect on their prior knowledge by predicting and self-explaining data outperform a control group in recall and comprehension. These effects persist when participants have moderate or little prior knowledge on the datasets. We discuss how the effects differ based on text versus visual presentations of data. We characterize the design space of graphical prediction and feedback techniques and describe design recommendations.},

Numerical magnitude development involves gaining increasingly precise knowledge of increasing ranges and types of numbers: from nonsymbolic to small symbolic numbers, from smaller to larger whole numbers, and from whole to rational numbers. One reason why this development is important is that precision of numerical magnitude knowledge is correlated with, predictive of, and causally related to both whole and rational number arithmetic. Rational number arithmetic, however, also poses challenges beyond understanding the magnitudes of the individual numbers. Some of these challenges are inherent; they are present for all learners. Other challenges are culturally contingent; they vary from country to country and classroom to classroom. Generating theories and data that help children surmount the challenges of rational number arithmetic is a promising and important goal for future numerical development research.},

Visuals framed around emotion (This is the debate)
The more plain, the more neutral; the more neutral, the more objective; and the more objective, the more true— or so this line of reasoning goes.
Alberto Cairo, the author of the visualization book The Truthful Art
A Unified Theory of Information Design, authors Nicole Amare and Alan Manning
god trick (Donna Haraway)

But persuasion is everywhere, even in spreadsheets. The god trick of seeing everything from nowhere.
The view from nowhere— from a distance, from up above, like a god— may be data visualization’smost signature feature.
it’s a trick because it makes the viewer believe that they can see everything, all at once, from an imaginary and impossible standpoint. But it’s also a trick because what appears to be everything, and what appears to be neutral, is always what she terms a partial perspective.


Edward Tufte (Data visualization minimalism)

Data Ink Ratio
Appeals to reason first


Data visualization has even been named as “the unempathetic art” by designer Mushon Zer- Aviv
A central focus of feminist scholarship has been to challenge false binaries like this one between reason and emotion and to point out how they establish hierarchies as well.
Third principle of data feminism: embrace emotion and embodiment.
The Curious Journalist’s Guide to Data, journalist Jonathan Stray
Hullman and coauthor Nicholas Diakopoulos

Their main argument was that visualizing data involves editorial choices: some things are necessarily highlighted, while others arenecessarily obscured. When designers make these choices, they carry along with them framing effects, which is to say they have an impact on how people interpret the graphics and what they take away from them.


feminist objectivity

a tool that can account for the situated nature of knowledge and can bring together multiple— what she terms partial— perspectives.
This form of objectivity works toward more inclusive knowledge production by centering the perspectives— or standpoints— of groups that are otherwise excluded from knowledge- making processes.


affect— the term that academics use to refer to emotions and other subjective feelings
Visual things are for the eyes, but visceralizations are representations of data that the whole body can experience, emotionally as well as physically— data that “we see, hear, feel, breathe and even ingest,” writes media theorist Luke Stark
iA Sort of Joy (Thousands of Exhausted Things)
people are terrible at recognizing uncertainty in data visualizations, even when they’re explicitly told that something is uncertain.

Hullman advocates for rendering experiences of uncertainty


Context is queen

it is never a good idea to say “never” in design


The third principle of data feminism, and the theme of this chapter, is to elevate emotion and embodiment.
In the case of data visualization, what is excluded is emotion and affect, embodimentand expression, embellishment and decoration. These are the aspects of human experience associated with women, and thus devalued by the logic of our master stereotype.
visual minimalism can coexist with emotion for maximum impact.

The Perceptual Process (simplified!) - This ends up in a cycle (not direct)

Stimulus in the environment

distal stimulus


Light is reflected and focused

light reflected from the object and reaching the visual receptors
principle of transformation: stimuli and responses created by stimuli are transformed, or changed, between the distal stimulus and perception
Eyes: light enters the eye and is transformed as it is focused by the eye's optical system (cornea at the front of the eye and the lens directly behind it).
Proximal Stimulus: Image formed on receptors of the person's retina (network of nerve cells that cover the back of the eye)
Principle of representation: everything a person perceives is based not on direct contact with stimuli but on representations of stimuli that are formed on the receptors and the resulting activity in the person's nervous system.


Receptor Processes

Sensory receptors: cells specialized to respond to environmental energy.

Visual receptors respond to light. They transform light energy into electrical energy because they contain a light-sensitive chemical called visual pigment.


The transformation of one from of energy (e.g. light energy) to another form (e.g. electrical energy) is called transduction.


Neural Processing (See chapters 2 \& 3)

understanding how nerons called cells work and interact with each other and the brain.
transmit signals from the receptors, through the retina, to the brain, and then within the brain
change (or process) these signals as they are transmitted.
Primary receiving area: electrical signals arrive at this for that sense in the cerebral cortex of the brain.

Cerebral cortext: 2 mm thick layer that contains the machinery for creating perceptions, as well as other functions (e.g. language, memory, and thinking)

occipital lobe: primary receiving area for vision.




Then transmitted to many other structures in the brain (e.g. frontal lobe receives signals from all the senses and plays important roles in perceptions that involve the coordination of info received through two or more senses.


Perception (What do you see?)
Recognition (What is that called?)

Visual form agnosia: inability to recognize objects


Action

Involves motor actions


Knowledge: placed inside one's brain. Information that a perceiver brings to a situation. (Cognitive Influences on Perception)




Sensation: involving simple "elementary" processes that occur right at the beginning of a sensory system (as when light stimulates receptors in the eye)
Perception: identified with complex processes that involve higher-order mechanisms (such as interpretation and memory that involve activity in the brain)

Effect of information that the perceiver brings to the situation

Bottom-up processing (data-based processing): processing that is based on the stimuli reaching the receptors.

provide a starting point for perception because perception involves activation of the receptors.
"incoming data" is the basis of bottom-up processing


Top-down processing (knowledge-based processing): processing that is based on knowledge.

	annote = {Chapter 2: The Beginning of the Perceptual Process

Light: The stimulus for vision

visible light: energy within the electromagnetic spectrum that humans can perceive, has wavelengths ranging from about 400 to 700 nanometers.
Eyes contain receptors for vision

pupil: light reflected from objects in the environment enters through the pupil
cornea: focused by the cornea
lens: form sarp images of the objects on the
retina: the network of neurons that covers the back of the eye and that contains the receptors for vision

visual receptors (rods and cones)

outer segment: part of the receptor that contains light-sensitive chemicals called visual pigments (react to light and trigger electrical signals)
optic nerve (back of the eye): conducts signals toward the brain


fovea (only cones) smalll!

macular degernation (destores cone-rich fovea)


peripheral retina (rods \& cones) more rods...

retinitis pigmentosa (attacks peripheral rod receptors) genetic.


blind spot: absense of receptors (CRAZY COOL DEMONSTRATION!)

the brain "fills in" the place where the image disappears with the surrounding pattern






20/20 vision

views a small object far away (located more than about 20 eed away) the light rays that reach the eye are essentially parallel, and the the cornea-lens combination brings these parallel rays to focus on the retina.
object moves closer to the eye, light rays reflected from object enter the eye at more of an angle (pushes focus point back so the back of the eye weren't there, light would be focused behind the retina.
Because the light is stopped by the back of the eye, the image on the retina is out of focus.
Adjustable lens controls accommodation: change in the lens's shape that occurs when the ciliary muscles at the front of the eye tighten and increase the curvature of the lens so that it gets thicker.

increased curvature increases the bending of the light rays passing through the lens so the focus point is pulled back to the back of the eye to create a sharp image on the retina.
aka: your eye is constantly adjusting its focus by accommodating, especially for nearby objects.
Issues:

Presbyopia: (old eye) as people get older, ability to accommodate decreases due to hardening of the lens and weakening of ciliary muslces. Hard to read at close range. Read reading glasses.
myopia (nearsightedness): inability to see distant objects clearly.

optical system brings parallel rays of light into focus at a point in front of the retina, so the image that reaches the retina is blurred.

refractive myopia: cornea and/or lens bends the light too much
axial myopia: eyeball is too long.
Use corrective lenses. to bend the light before entering the cornea and lens.




hyperopia (farsightedness): can see distant objects clearly but have trouble seeing nearby objects

focus point for parallel rays of light is located behind the retina, usually because the eyeball is too short.
young people can usually accomodate.
older people need corrective lenses.








Receptors and Perception

transduction (transforms light into electricity by cones and rods)
Visual pgments: (protien called opsin and retinal)

isomerization (retinal straightens by light) activates receptor.


Dark adaptation (curve) SEE MYTH BUSTERS 2007

first phase caused by cones
second phase caused by rods

rod monochromats (genetic defect missing cones)


We first see with our cones, but then switch to see with our rods (3-5 minutes) after lights turn off.
visual pigment regeneration: lighter bleached state they are no longer useful for vision, in order to do their job of changing light energy into electrical energy, the retinal needs to return to its bent shape and become reattached to the opsin. (reforming visual pigment)

cone pigment takes 6 minutes to regenerate and rod pigment takes more than 30 minutes.
detached retina: person becomes blind unless laser surgery reatttaches the retinal to the opsin.


Our sensitivity to light depends on concentration of the visual pigment
the speed at which our sensitivity increases in the dark depends on a chemical reaction (the regeneration of the visual pigment)


Rods are more sensitive to short-wavelenth light than cones are.
vision shifts to become relatively more sensitive to short-wavelength light (light nearer the blue and green end of the spectrum) IS THIS WHY GREEN IS GOOD?!

Purkinje shift (green foliage seems to stand out more near dark)




Electrical Signals: (occur in neurons)

refractory period: interval between the time one nerve impulse occurs and the next one can be generated in the axon.
spontaneous activity: action potentials that occur in the absence of stimuli from the environment. (baseline levels of firing for the neuron)
synapse (very small space between the neurons)

neurotransmitters (chemicals) flow into the synapse to small areas on the receiving neuron called receptor sites. (like a key in a lock)

Two types of responses can occur at the receptor sites:

excitatory: the inside of the neuron becomes more positive (depolariazation)
inhibitory: the inside of the neuron becomes more negative (hyperpolarization)








Neural Convergence and Perception:

Neural circuits: interconnected groups of neurons within the retina
Signals generated in the receptors travel to the bipolar cells and then to the ganglion cells.
Two types of neurons that connect neurons across the retina: horizontal and amacrine cells.
Neutral convergence: a number of neurons synapse onto a single neuron.
Signals from the rods converge more than do the signals from the cones

rods result in better sensitivity than cones
cones result in better detail vision than the rods.

visual acuity is highest n the fovea (objects that are imaged on the peripheral retina are not seen as clearly)

Cones have better visual acuity because they have less convergence.
Acuity: ability to see details.

Chevreul illiusion (four gray rectangles placed side by side) aka staircase illusion

Each bipolar cell sends inhibition to its neighbors.

what if you make the squares curvy?




Processing from retina to visual cortex and beyond

Receptive Field: the region of the retina that must receive illumination in order to obtain a response in any given fiber

center surround organization: the "center" of the receptive field responds differently to light than the area in the "surround" of the receptive field.
excitatory area: a spot of light to the center increases firing
inhibitory: stimulation of the surround causes a decrease in firing.
receptive fields can have oppositely responding areas.


Hubel and Wesel: extended study of receptive fields into the cortex

travel form the eye to the lateral geniculate nucleaus in thalamus (in your brain) then to the occipital lobe (visual receiving area) of the cerebral cortex.
the lateral geniculate nucleaus receives more signals from the cortex than from the retina. aka feedback (backward flow of information)
orientation tuning curve: relationship between orientation and firing


feature detectors: simple, complex, and end-stopped cells fire in response to specific features of the stimulus, such as orientation or direction of movement.

do theses play a role in perception? probs.




Selective Adaptation: firing causes neurons to eventually become fatigued, or adapt.

the neuron's firing rate decreases
the neuron fires less when that stimulus is immediately presented again.


Selective Rearing: if an animal is reared in an environment that contains only certain types of stimuli, then neurons that respond to these stimuli will become more prevalent. "Use it or lose it"

cats in vertical or horizontal tubes.


Sensory coding: neurons represent various characteristics of the environment.
Specificity coding: firing of a specialized neuron that responds only to that object
Population coding: representation of a particular object by the pattern of firing of a large number of neurons.
Sparse coding: particular object is represented by a pattern of firing of only a small group of neurons with the majority of neurons remaining silent.

	annote = {Chapter 4: Cortical Organization

Spatial organization: how different locations in the environment and on the retina are represented by activity at the specific location in the visual cortex.

Objects become organized by "neural maps"
retinotipic map: electronic map of the retina on the cortex. Two points that are close together on an object and on the retina will activate neurons that are close together in the brain.


Cortical magnification: apportioning of a large area on the cortex to the small fovea. (size is the cortical magnification factor).
Location columns: striate cortex is organized into location columns that are perpendicular to the surface of the cortex.

hypercolumn: recieves info about all possible orientations that fall within a small area of the retina.


Tilling: the visual field is served by adjacent and often overlapping location columns.
Ablation: destruction or removal of tissue in the nervous system.

object discrimination problem
landmark discrimination problem

ventral pathway (what)
dorsal pathway (where) (how pathway or action pathway)

(think of a human with a dorsal fin from a dolphin sticking out of his head)






***FEEDBACK, provides information from higher centers that can influence the signals flowing into the system. This mechanism is behind top-down processing.
neuropsychology: study of the behavior effects of brain damage in humans

there is one mechanism for judging orientation and another for coordinating vision and action.


Modularity: the idea that specific areas of the cortex are specialized to respond to specific types of stimuli.

fusiform face area (FFA) activity remained in this area when shown faces

prospagnosia: damage to the temporal lobe causes this difficulty recognizing the faces of familiar people.


parahippocampal place area (PPA) activated by pictures dipicting indoor and outdoor scenes
extrastriate body area (EBA) activated by pictures of bodies and parts of bodies (but not faces)


Distributed representation: stimulus causes neural activity in a number of different areas of the brain, so the activity is distributed across the brain.
hippocampus: area associated with forming and storing memories
expertise hypothesis: our proficiency in perceiving certain things can be explained by changes in the brain caused by long exposure, practice, or training (Identifying Greebles vs Faces)
},
	annote = {Chapter 5: Perceiving Objects and Scenes

A particular image on the retina can be created by many different objects in the environment.
Objects can be hidden or blurred.
Objects look different from different viewpoints.

viewpoint invariance: ability to recognize an object seen from different viewpoints.


Perceptual organization: the process by which elements in the environment become perceptually grouped to creat our perception of objects.

grouping: process by which visual events are "put together" into units or objects
segregation: the process of separating one area or object from another.


Gestalt (configuration) psychologists: How are configurations formed from smaller elements. Questioned structuralism.

Structuralism: distinguished between sensations (elementary processes that occur in response to the simulation) and perceptions (more complex conscious experiences such as our awareness of objects).

think chemistry: atoms combine to create complex molecular structures (aka sensations combine to create complex perceptions)


Apparent movement: illusion of movement created by the stroboscope. although movement is perceived, nothing is actually moving.
"The whole is different than the sum of its parts"

illusory contours




Gestalt Principles of Perceptual Organization: determine how elements in a scene become grouped together.

good continuation: points that, when connected, result in straight or smoothly curving lines are seen as belonging together, and the lines tend to be seen in such a way as to follow the smoothest path. Objects that are partially covered by other objects are seen as continuing behind the covering object. (rope on the ground overlapping)
pragnanz (good figure) (simplicity): Every stimulus pattern is seen in such a way that the resulting structure is as simple as possible. (Olympic circles symbol)
Similarity: similar things appear to be grouped together. (same color are grouped together, shape, size, orientation)
Proximity (Nearness): things that are near each other appear to be grouped together.
Common Fate: Things that are moving in the same direction appear to be grouped together. (can occur even if the objects are dissimilar)
Common Region: elements that are within the same region of space appear to be grouped together. (overpowers proximity)
Uniform connectedness: connected region of the same visual properties, such as lighness, color, texture, or motion, is perceived as a single unit (overpowers proximity).


Perceptual Segregation: the perceptual separation of one object from another.

figure-ground segregation: you see a figure that stands out from its background which is called the ground.

Rubin's reversible face-vase figure
the figure is more "thinglike" and more memorable than the ground.
the figure is seen as being in front of the ground.
near the boarders it shares with the figure, the ground is seen as nformed material, without a specific shape, and seems to extend behind the figure.
boarder ownership: property of the border belonging to one area.


Determining the figure:

areas lower in the field of view are more likely to be perceived as figure.
figures are more likely to be perceived on the convex side of borders (boarders that bulge outward)

this was challenged: segregation is determined not by just what is happening at a single border but by what is happening in the wider scene.


Perceptual Principles and Experience:

built in principles can override experience (W and M on top of each other - good continuation)
figure has to be separated from the ground before we can assign a meaning to the figure.

challenged: figure-ground formation can be affected by the meaningfulness of a stimulus. The process of recognition must be occurring either before or at the same time as the figure is being separated from the ground.








Perceiving scenes and objects in scenes:

scene: a view of a real-world environment that contains (1) background elements and (2) multiple objects that are organized in a meaningful way relative to each other and the background.

objects are compact and are acted upon whereas scenes are extended in space and acted within.


gist of a scene: description of the type of scene

(visual mask stimulus) a random pattern that covers the original stimulus since persistence of vision occurs (visual stimulus continues for about 250 ms after the stimulus is extinguished).
global image features: observers use information which can be perceived rapidly and are associated with specific types of scenes (holistic and rapidly perceived)

degree of naturalness
degree of openness
degree of roughness
degree of expansion
color




Regularities in the environment: characteristics of the environment which occur frequently

physical regularities: regularly occurring physical properties of the environment

light from above assumption


semantic regularities: characteristics associated with activities that are common in different types of scenes

scene schema: knowledge of what a given scene typically contains




Theory of unconscious inference:

likelihood principle: we perceive the object that is most likely to have caused the pattern of stimuli we have received.
unconscious inference: our perceptions are the result of unconscious assumptions, or inferences, that we make about the environment.


Bayesian Inference:

(1) Helmholtz's idea that we resolve the ambiguity of the retinal image by inferring what is most likely, given the situation (2) the idea that regularities in the environment provide information we can use to resolve ambiguities
Named after Thomas Bayes (1701 - 1761)
Our estimate of the probability of an outcome is determined by two factors:

the prior probability, or simply the prior, which is our initial estimate of the probability of an outcome
the extent to which the available evidence is consistent with the outcome (likelihood of the outcome)




Binocular rivalry: the observer perceives either the left-eye image or the right-eye image, but not both at the same time.
Spatial layout hypothesis: the PPA/PHC responds to the surface geometry or geometric layout of a scene.
Structural encoding \& semantic encoding
Faces are special.

	annote = {Chapter 6: Visual Attention

attention: process of focusing on specific objects while ignoring others
visual scanning: looking from one place to another.

aiming your fovea at (one face) after another
fixation: (paused on one face) provide us with the opportunity to focus on a particular person (or object) so that we can recognize him or her (or it).
saccadic eye movement: a rapid jerky movement from one fixation to the next.
overt attention: involves looking directly at the attended object.
covert attention: attention without looking.


what directs our attention?

visual salience: scene regions that are markedly different from their surroundings whether in color, contrast, movement, or orientation. (red diamond vs green circle)

attentional capture: properties of stimulus grab attention, seemingly against a person's will.




Cognitive factors:

scene schemas: an observer's knowledge about what is contained in typical scenes.


Benefits of attention:

when we attend to something, we become aware of it.
attention speeds responding

spatial attention: attention to a specific location.
precueing: determine whether presenting a cue indicating where a test stimulus will appear enhances the processing of the test stimulus.

information processing is more effective at the place where attention is directed.


same-object advantage: faster responding that occurs when enhancement spreads within an object


attention can influence appearance
attention can influence physiological responding


Attention and Experiencing a Coherent World

binding: process by which visual features, such as color, form motion, and location, are combined to create our perception of a coherent object.
binding problem: how an object's individual features become bound together.
Feature Integration Theory: how we perceive individual features as parts of the same object

preattentive stage: occurs BEFORE we focus attention on an object.

attention not involved. automatic, unconscious, and effortless.


focused attention stage: independent features are combined.


divided attention: subjects are given multiple tasks to complete at once.

illusory conjunctions: combinations of features from different stimuli
Balint's syndrome: inability to focus and shift attention when multiple objects are present in a scene.


visual search: look for an object among a number of other objects.

conjunction search vs feature search




What happens when we don't attend?

inattentional blindness: subjects can be unaware of clearly visible stimuli if they aren't directing their attention to them.
change blindness: difficulty in detecting changes in scenes

continuity errors (in movies)




Distraction:

unattended stimuli attract our attention
task-irrelevant stimuli: stimuli that don't provide information relevant to the task at hand.
load theory of attention

perceptual capacity: a person has a certain capacity that can be used for carrying out perceptual tasks
perceptual load: amount of a person's perceptual capacity needed to carry out a particular perceptual task
"Demands my full attention"
Distracted driving! fewer mental resources available to focus on driving




},
	annote = {Chapter 8: Perceiving Motion

Observers perceive shapes more rapidly and accurately when an object is moving.
attentional capture: our attention is automatically drawn to salient objects (motion is avery salient aspect of the environment)
event boundary: the point in time when each of these events ends and the next one begins

motion usually occurs here.


akinetopsia (motion blindness) motion is either very difficult or impossible to perceive.
real motion: actual motion of an object
illusory motion: perception of motion when there actually is none

apparent motion (chapter 5) (movies, tv, moving signs that are used for advertising and entertainment)


induced motion: motion of one object (usually a large one) causes a nearby stationary object (usually smaller) to appear to move.
motion aftereffects: when viewing a moving stimulus causes a stationary stimulus to appear to move.

watterfall illusion


optic array: the structure created by the surfaces, textures, and contours of the environment

local disturbance in the optic array


global optic flow: the environment is stationary and the observer is moving (either by moving body or scanning eyes)
Reichardt detector:
Corollary discharge theory: takes eye movement into account

image displacement signal
motor signal
corollary discharge signal


Comparator: brain strucutre or mechanism that receives both the IDS and CDS
real-motion neuron
Middle temporal (MT) area
coherence: the degree to which the dots move in the same direction
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): remove that part of the brain...WHAT?!!!! WHO DOES SUCH A THING?!
Microstimulation: lowering a small wire electrode into the cortex and passing a week electrical charge through the tip of the electrode
aperture problem: only a small portion of a larger stimulus can result in misleading information about the direction in which the stimulus is moving
shortest path constraint: apparent movement tends to occur along the shortest path between two stimuli
point-light walkers: created by placing small lights on people's joints and then filming the patterns created by these lights when people walk and carry out other actions in the dark.
representational momentum: the idea that the motion depicted in a picture tends to continue in the observer's mind
},
	annote = {Chapter 9: Perceiving Color

Cerebral achromatopsia: color blindness caused by a cortical injury after a lifetime of experiencing color.
Color and Light: Isaac Newton's experiment (1704) with a windo shade and prism.

light in each part of the spectrum is defined by different physical properties and that these physcial differences give rise to our perception of different colors
our perception of color depends critically on the wavelengths of light that enter our eyes.


Chromatic colors: (blue, green, red) occur when some wavelengths are reflected more than others (called selective reflection)
Achromatic colors: (white, gray, black) occur when light is reflected equally across the spectrum.
Reflectance curves: plot the percentage of light
Selective transmission: only some wavelengths pass through the object or substance

transmission curves: plots the percentage of light trransmission at each wavelength.


Subtractive color mixture: mixing paints
Mixing lights: does not work the same as mixing paints...
Additive color mixture (mixing lights)
Perceptual Dimensions of Colors

spectral colors (ROYGBIV)
non-spectral colors
hues (chromatic colors) blue, green, and red
Saturation: determined by the amount of white that has been added to a particular hue

Desaturated: take on a faded or washed-out appearance


Value: light-to-dark dimension of color
color solid: 3D color space
HSV color solid: 3D are hue, saturation, and value


Trichromatic Theory of Color Vision

trichromatic theory of vision: proposal that color vision is based on three principal colors (Young-Helmholtz theory)

color matching: any color could be matched provided that subjects were able to adjust the proportions of three wavelengths in the comparison field.
cone-pigments: our perception of colors is determined by the pattern of activity in different kinds of receptors
metamerism: two physically different stimuli are perceptually identical

metamers: two identical fields in a color-matching experiment


monochromats: one type of pigment; see in shades of gray
dichromats: two types of cone pigment; see chromatic colors
trichromats: 3 pigments: provides additional ratios that allow additional discrimination of wavelengths across the visual spectrum


opponent-process theory of color vision:

caused by opposing physiological responses generated by blue and yellow, red and green, and black and white.
Hering's primary colors (red, yellow, green, or blue)
poor acceptance...

however...

colors seem to drop out in pairs (e.g. can't see red and green)
complementary afterimages...
opponent neurons: in retina and lateral geniculate nucleus that responded with an exitatory response to light from one part of the spectrum and with an inhabitory response to light fro another part.






BOTH are correct


Color in the Cortex:

single- and double-opponent neurons


Color Deficiency:

Monochromatism (Color blind): rare form of color blindness that is usually hereditary and occurs in only about 10 people out of 1 million.

Have no functioning cones
Vision has the characteristics of rod vision in both dim and bright lights.
See only in shades of lightness (white, gray, and black)


Dichromatism (color deficient): missing one of the three cone pigments and hence experience some colors.

cannot distinguish as many colors as can trichromats.
Ishihara plates: diagnoses color deficiency is a color vision test
unilateral dichromat: a person with trichromatic vision in one eye and dichromatic vision in the other
3 types:

protanopia

affects 1\% of males and 0.02 of females
missing the long-wavelength pigment -{\textgreater} perceives short-wavelength light as blue
neutral point: wavelength at which the protanope perceives gray
above neutral point, perceives yellow


deuteranopia

affects 1\% of males and 0.01\% of females.
missing the medium wavelength.
perceives blue at short wavelengths and yellow at long wavelengths.


tritanopia

very rare, affects 0.002\% of males and 0.001\% of females.
missing the short-wavelength pigment.
sees blue as short wavelengths and red at long wavelengths.






Anomalous trichromatism: needs 3 wavelengths to match any wavelength, but mixes the wavelengths in different proportions.


Color in a dynamic world:

color constancy: perceive the colors of objects as being relatively constant even under changing illumination.
chromatic adaptation: color perception can be changed by prolonged exposure to chromatic color

partial color constancy: perception of the object is shifted after adaptation
tones down the dominant colors in a scene


memory color: effect on perception of prior knowledge of the typical colors of objects.

Judge these familiar objects as having richer more saturated colors than familiar objects that reflect the same wavelengths.




light constancy:

lightness: the perception of the shade of achromatic color
lightness constancy: the fact that we see white, grays, and blacks as staying about the same shade under different illuminations
ratio principle: as long as this ratio remains the same, the perceived lightness will remain the same.
lightness perception under uneven illumination (shadows)

reflectance edge: an edge where the reflectance of two surfaces changes.
illumination edge: an edge where the lighting changes.




The nervous system is responsible for the quality of our experience.

	annote = {Chapter 10: Perceiving Size and Depth

cue approach to depth perception: identifying info in the retinal image that is correlated with depth in the scene

occlusion: a cue that one object is in front of another
Cues:

Oculomotor: created by :

convergence, the inward movement of the eyes that occurs when we look at nearby objects
accommodation: the change in the shape of the lens that occurs when we focus on objects at various distances


Monocular: work with only one eye

accommodation
pictorial cues: sources of depth info that can be depicted in a picture
relative height: objects with their bases closer to the horizon are usually seen as being more distant.

being higher in the field of view causes objects on the ground to appear farther away
being lower in the field of view causes objects in the sky to appear farther away


familiar size: when we judge distance based on our prior knowledge of the sizes of objects.
relative size: when two objects are known to be of equal physical size, the one that is farther away will take up less of your field of view than the one that is closer.
prospective convergence: when you look down parallel railroad tracks that appear to converge in the distance.
atmospheric perspective: the farther away an object is, the more air and particles (dust, water droplets, etc.) we have to look through so that distant objects appear less sharp than nearer objects and often have a slight blue tint.
texture gradient: our perception of the resulting change in texture.
shadows: decreases in light intensity caused by the blockage of light. Also enhance the 3D of objects.
Motion produced cues:

motion parallax:

Occurs when, as we move, nearby objects appear to glide rapidly past us, but more distant objects appear to move more slowly


deletion and accretion: as an observer moves side to side, some things become covered, and others become uncovered.




Binocular: Two eye'd depth perception (3D movies)

steroscoptic depth perception: depth perception created by input from both eyes
binocular disparity: the difference in the images on the left and right retinas.

corresponding retinal points: points on the retina that would overlap if the eyes were superimposed on each other.
noncorresponding points: the images that are not on the horopter.

absolute disparity:the degree to which the image deviates from falling on the coresponding points
angle of disparity: amount of absolute disparity
crossed disparity: left eye sees an object on  right of the observer's fixation point and the right eye sees the same object to the left of the fixation point. (you would need to "cross" your eyes in order to fixate the object)
uncrossed disparity: left eye sees an object on  left of the observer's fixation point and the right eye sees the same object to the right of the fixation point. (you would need to "uncross" your eyes in order to fixate the object)
relative disparity: the difference in absolute disparities of obejcts in a scene.


random-dot sterogram








Perceiving Size

visual angle: the angle of an object relative to the observer's eye. (covering the moon with your thumb)
size constancy: our perception of an object's size is realtively constant even when we view the object from different distances is called size constancy.

size-distance scaling: takes an object's distance into account:

S = K(R x D)


Emmert's law: the farther away an afterimage appears, the larger it will seem.


Other info for size perception:

we often use the sizes of familiar objects as a yardstick to judge the size of other objects.
relationship between objects and texture information on the ground.


Muller-Lyer Illusion (inside and outside corners - differences in depth)

Misapplied size constancy scaling


Conflicting cues theory: our perception of line length depends on two cues

the actual length of the vertical lines
the overall length of the figure


Ponzo Illusion (railroad track illusion)
The Ames room
The Moon Illusion

the apparent distance theory
angular size contrast theory


Depth Information Across Species:

frontal eyes: result in overlapping fields of view (humans, cats, etc.)
lateral eyes: do not have overlapping visual fields (rabbits)

Participants then took a test of graphicacy skills. As predicted, the format inﬂuenced viewers’ interpretations of data. Speciﬁcally, viewers were more likely to describe x–y interactions when viewing line graphs than when viewing bar graphs, and they were more likely to describe main effects and ‘‘z–y’’ (the variable in the legend) interactions when viewing bar graphs than when viewing line graphs. Familiarity of data presented and individuals’ graphicacy skills interacted with the inﬂuence of graph format. Speciﬁcally, viewers were most likely to generate inferences only when they had high graphicacy skills, the data were familiar and thus the information inferred was expected, and the format supported those inferences.

Part-sum method: at least within a particular experimental condition, the magnitudes of the two physical stimuli always sum to the same constant.
Dimensionality: 0, 1, 2, 3

I guess higher dimensions are okay?

an increase in the apparent dimensionality of a graphical element is not necessarily associated with a concomitant decrease in the Stevens's law exponent
Elements with apparent dimensionalities greater than one were judged as though the elements possessed only one dimension, but they were judged more quickly than lower dimensional elements.

We combine simple texture patternswith perceptually uniform colors to increasethe number of attribute values we can display simultaneously. Our technique builds multicolored perceptual texture elements (or pexels) to represent each data element. Attribute values encoded in an element are used to vary the appearance of its pexel. Texture and color patterns that form when the pexels are displayed can be used to rapidly and accurately explore the dataset. Our pexels are built by varying three separate texture dimensions: height, density, and regularity. Results from computer graphics, computer vision, and human visual psychophysics have identifiedthese dimensions as importantfor the formation of perceptualtexture patterns. The pexelsare colored using a selection technique that controls color distance, linear separation, and color category. Proper use of these criteria guarantees colors that are equally distinguishable from one another. We describe a set of controlled experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our texture dimensions and color selection criteria. We then discuss new work that studies how texture and color can be used simultaneously in a single display. Our results show that variations of height and density have no effect on color segmentation, but that random color patterns can interfere with texture segmentation. As the difficulty of the visual detection task increases, so too does the amount of color on texture interference increase. We conclude by demonstrating the applicability of our approach to a real-world problem, the tracking of typhoon conditions in Southeast Asia.},

human information processing capabilities- the ability to recognize, classify, and remember visual patterns.


We do not know much about the perceptual, psychophysical, and cognitive processes that arc invoked during the examination of a graph.

We often rely on intuition to guide us in deciding whether a graph is good or bad, and we do not know how damaging "bad" graphs are.
because they are intended for an audience that is generally less expert than their author, presentation graphs necessarily tend to be simple in form and content


Pie Charts: Good vs Bad

For many years, the use of pie charts was frowned upon by statistical experts, based on psychophysical evidence (see Baird, 1970, for a review) that judgments of area, angle, and arc length are less accurate than judgments of length. Hence, the bar chart was favored.
A critical review of the existing evidence suggests that the prejudice against the pie chart is unfounded.
In spite of these results, modern commentators continue to advocate the bar chart in preference to the pie chart.


areas are systematically underestimated whereas line lengths are not.
Cleveland \& McGill

perceptual judgments of six basic stimuli were examined: (1) position along a common scale, (2) position along nonaligned scales, (3) length, (4) angle, (5) slope, and (6) area.


Spence (1989)

examined the speed and accuracy with which subjects judge the visual elements that make up pie charts, bar charts, and several variants, and also estimated the power function exponents for each element.
the addition of extra dimensions is not harmful, provided that base size remains constant.


Culbertson and Powers (1959)

a series of individual bars (either horizontally or vertically oriented) is superior to a line graph if specific quantities must be estimated.


Schutz (1961 b)

recommends that when several time series (in the experiment, he varied their number from two to four) are to be compared simultaneously, all variables should be shown as multiple lines in a single graph, rather than as individual lines in separate panels.


Paivio (1974)

summarizes several studies and concludes that there is at least a 10\% advantage in recall for pictures over words or sentences.
numerical information was better remembered when presented in a graph than when embedded in text.
By extension, if ways can be found to construct graphs that encourage and facilitate the formation of interacting images, memory for such graphs should be improved.


Tufte

advises maximizing the "data ink ratio"; that is, the ratio of printer's ink used for data to the ink used for other parts of the graph.
the graphs presented by Tufte as examples of good graphical practice are rather stark and minimalist. In ouropinion, people are more likely to be drawn to attractive, appealing graphs and, conversely, to be repelled by dry, sterile depictions of the data, devoid of even the slightest decoration. If a graph is not examined, it might as well not have been drawn. Moreover, we speculate that a decorated graph may be better remembered than a minimalist chart, anissue not considered by Tufte ( 1983).


Bobko and Karren (1979)

suggested that people's estimates are closer to the square of the correlation (r2) rather than to the correlation itself. Strahan



Cleveland and McGill ( 1984b)


advocate smoothing of scatterplots to assist in detecting the shape of the point cloud in situations where the error in the data is substantial, or where the density of points changes along the abscissa.



Multivariate displays are used to find clusters of related data points and to detect outlying or atypical points.

Use of Faces for symbols? Weird.

Existing uncertainty visualizations may not align with user needs or how they naturally reason about probability. We present a novel mobile interface design and visualization of uncertainty for transit predictions on mobile phones based on discrete outcomes. To develop it, we identified domain specific design requirements for visualizing uncertainty in transit prediction through: 1) a literature review, 2) a large survey of users of a popular realtime transit application, and 3) an iterative design process. We present several candidate visualizations of uncertainty for realtime transit predictions in a mobile context, and we propose a novel discrete representation of continuous outcomes designed for small screens, quantile dotplots. In a controlled experiment we find that quantile dotplots reduce the variance of probabilistic estimates by {\textasciitilde}1.15 times compared to density plots and facilitate more confident estimation by end-users in the context of realtime transit prediction scenarios.},

If cognitive processes parallel perceptual processes, then fundamental psychophysical laws should hold for each. To test this, we analyzed both behavioral and neuronal representations of numerosity in the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys. The data were best described by a nonlinearly compressed scaling of numerical information, as postulated by the Weber-Fechner law or Stevens’ law for psychophysical/sensory magnitudes. This nonlinear compression was observed on the neural level during the acquisition phase of the task and maintained through the memory phase with no further compression.

Therefore, if a continuumbetween perceptual and cognitive processes exists, numerical representations should also be represented on a nonlinear, compressed “number scale.”
To reach equal discriminability for numerosities smaller and larger than the sample numerosity, the numerical distance between sample and test must be larger if the test numerosity is higher than the sample. This effect should become even more obvious for larger magnitudes.

the idea is that compression enlarges the coding space, thus increasing the dynamic range of perception and firing neurons.

Computer game technology offers the opportunity to experience how often an event occurs, rather than simply read about its frequency. Objective. To assess effects of interactive graphics on risk perceptions and decisions. Design. Electronic questionnaire. Participants and setting. Respondents (n = 165) recruited online or at an urban hospital. Intervention. Health risks were illustrated by either static graphics or interactive game-like graphics. The interactive search graphic was a grid of squares, which, when clicked, revealed stick figures underneath. Respondents had to click until they found a figure affected by the disease. Measurements. Risk feelings, risk estimates, intention to take preventive action. Results. Different graphics did not affect mean risk estimates, risk feelings, or intention. Low-numeracy participants reported significantly higher risk feelings than high-numeracy ones except with the interactive search graphic. Unexpectedly, respondents reported stronger intentions to take preventive action when the intention question followed questions about efficacy and disease severity than when it followed perceived risk questions (65\% v. 34\%; P {\textless} 0.001). When respondents reported risk feelings immediately after using the search graphic, the interaction affected perceived risk (the longer the search to find affected stick figures, the higher the risk feeling: r = 0.57; P = 0.009). Limitations. The authors used hypothetical decisions. Conclusions. A game-like graphic that allowed consumers to search for stick figures affected by disease had no main effect on risk perception but reduced differences based on numeracy. In one condition, the game-like graphic increased concern about rare risks. Intentions for preventive action were stronger with a question order that focused first on efficacy and disease severity than with one that focused first on perceived risk.

The authors examined the relationships between risk level (high v. low) and format of risk presentation (ratio, pictogram, or Paling Perspective Scale) and whether these relationships differed based on the numeracy skills of the participant. 

Results. The authors identified a significant (P {\textless} 0.001) 3-way interaction between format, risk level, and numeracy: high-numerate participants in the low-risk group perceived the test results as less risky compared with participants in the high-risk group (P {\textless} 0.001) with the Paling Perspective Scale but not with the other formats. For lownumerate participants, they did not observe differences between low- and high-risk scenarios for any of the 3 formats. The results were similar for the Down syndrome and colon cancer scenarios. Overall, the pictogram resulted in significantly lower risk ratings compared with the Paling Perspective Scale and the ratio with numerator 1 (P {\textless} 0.001). 

Conclusion. Different communication formats may produce different risk perceptions, but the effect is qualified by patients’ numeracy skills.

Our previous study indicated that participants did not use the logarithmic scale to rate the risk.15We obtained similar resultswhenwe compared the Paling Perspective Scale with a list providing comparative risk information. It seems unlikely, therefore, that the logarithmic scale is the reason why low-numerate individuals did not differentiate between high- and low-risk levels. In addition, the magnifier scale employing a logarithmic scale23 was found to be used by low-numerate individuals in the same way as by high-numerate individuals. Further research evaluating risk communication formats that provide comparative information as a table is needed to qualify this conclusion.


Compare high- and low-numerate individuals.

	abstract = {Background. Quantitative risk information plays an important role in decision making about health. This study focuses on commonly used numerical and graphical formats and examines their effect on perception of different likelihoods and choice preferences. Methods. An experimental study was conducted with 192 participants, who evaluated 2 sets of 4 lotteries. Numerical formats to describe likelihood varied systematically between participants (X\%, X-in-100, or 1-in-X). The effect of  graphic formats (bar charts, icon charts) was assessed as a withinsubjects factor. Dependent measures included perceived likelihood, choice preferences about participating in the lottery, and processing times. Results. Numerical likelihoods presented as 1-in-X were processed fastest and were perceived as conveying larger likelihoods than the X-in-100 and percentages formats (mean response times in seconds: 5.65 v. 7.31 and 6.50; mean rating on a 1–9 scale: 4.38 v. 3.30 and 3.31, respectively). The 1-in-X format also evoked a stronger willingness to participate in a lottery than the 2 other numerical formats. The effect of adding graphs on perceived likelihood was moderated by numerical aptitude. Graphs reduced ratings of perceived likelihood of participants with lower numeracy, while there was no overall effect for participants with higher numeracy. Conclusion. Perception of likelihood differs significantly depending on the numerical format used. The 1-in-X format yields higher perceived likelihoods and it appears to be the easiest format to interpret. Graphs primarily affect perception of likelihood of people with lower numerical aptitude. These effects should be taken into account when discussing medical risks with patients.

The logarithm is an extremely powerful and useful tool for graphical data presentation. One reason is that logarithms tum ratios into differences , and for many sets of data, it is natural to think in terms of ratios.

Assume t/u = v/w

Then on a graph involving these four numbers on the original scale, it is difficult to visually detect the equality of the ratios withoutreading numerical values from the scale and doing mental arithmetic.
If we plot logarithms we have a much better chance of detecting equality, since it is now a matter of perceiving that the distance along the log scale of log (t) to log (u) is equal to the distance from log (v) to log (w); thisis a reasonable graphical perceptual chore.




Resolution

Data that are amounts or counts are often very skewed to the right; on graphs of such data, there are a few large values that take up most of the scale and the majority of the points are squashed into a small region of the scale with no resolution.


Log base 2 and log base e should always be considered.
natural logarithms have a wonderful property

Suppose t and u are positive numbers and tlv =1 + r, where r is between - .25 and .25. Then to a good approximation, log (ti v) is r . For r positive the largest error in this range is for r = .25: log (I + .25) = .223. For r negative the largest error in this range is for r = - .25: log(1 - .25) = - .287. Thus on a natural log plot, if two values-log (t) and log (u)-differ by an amount log (t) - log (u) = r that is between - .25 and .25, then we know tis approximately 100,\% larger than u if r is positive and 100,\% smaller if r is negative.


Multibased logging is important for presenting data on log scales; using base 2 or base e in place of base IO can frequently enhance understanding of the variation in the data.

	abstract = {In public health crises, the media and governments routinely share statistical analyses with the public. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the tool most commonly used to convey statistical information about the spread of the virus has been time-series graphs about the cumulative number of cases. When drawing such graphs, analysts have to make design decisions which can have dramatic effects on citizens’ interpretations. Plotting the COVID-19 progression on a linear scale highlights an exponential “explosion” in the number of cases, whereas plotting the number of cases on a logarithmic scale produces a line with a modest-looking slope. Even if the two graphs display the exact same information, differences in visual design may lead people to different substantive conclusions. In this study, we measure the causal effect of different visualization design choices on Canadians’ views about the crisis. We report results from a survey experiment conducted in April 2020 with a sample of 2500 respondents. We find that no matter how the information is presented, Canadians are united in supporting drastic confinement measures and in accepting that these measures will not be removed soon.},

Overall, these results reveal both universal and culture-dependent facets of the sense of number. After a minimal instruction period, even members of a remote culture with reduced vocabulary and education readily understand that number can be mapped onto a spatial scale. The exact form of this mapping switches dramatically from logarithmic to linear, however, depending on the ages at which people are tested, the education they have received, and the format in which numbers are presented.
Weber's law: the fact that larger numbers require a proportional larger difference in order to remain equally discriminate.

It is not yet known which critical educational or cultural experience turns this initial representation into a linear scale.

We present multiple graphically-based techniques for eliciting and incorporating a user’s prior knowledge about data into visualization interaction. We use controlled experiments to evaluate how graphically eliciting forms of prior knowledge and presenting feedback on the gap between prior knowledge and the observed data impacts a user’s ability to recall and understand the data. We ﬁnd that participants who are prompted to reﬂect on their prior knowledge by predicting and self-explaining data outperform a control group in recall and comprehension. These effects persist when participants have moderate or little prior knowledge on the datasets. We discuss how the effects differ based on text versus visual presentations of data. We characterize the design space of graphical prediction and feedback techniques and describe design recommendations.},

Numerical magnitude development involves gaining increasingly precise knowledge of increasing ranges and types of numbers: from nonsymbolic to small symbolic numbers, from smaller to larger whole numbers, and from whole to rational numbers. One reason why this development is important is that precision of numerical magnitude knowledge is correlated with, predictive of, and causally related to both whole and rational number arithmetic. Rational number arithmetic, however, also poses challenges beyond understanding the magnitudes of the individual numbers. Some of these challenges are inherent; they are present for all learners. Other challenges are culturally contingent; they vary from country to country and classroom to classroom. Generating theories and data that help children surmount the challenges of rational number arithmetic is a promising and important goal for future numerical development research.},

in short, the more data points, the worse the extrapolations.
extrapolation of exponential functions improves when less data points are shown. Is this improvement due to an increased sensitivity to growth or to an overall willingness to produce large numbers?

the willingness to produce large numbers, a, is affected when many data points are presented.


when predicting future points on a time series, participants underestimated amount graphed when they were presented more data. These researchers presented participants with a number of data points (ns=3, 5, or 7) and required them to specify thevalue that would be reached after another k years if the process went on uninhibited. The judgments of participants were greater (and hence more accurate) when fewer data points were presented. Wagenaar and Timmers argued that series with fewer data points impart the message that the next value should be large.

Speciﬁcally, viewers were more likely to describe x–y interactions when viewing line graphs than when viewing bar graphs, and they were more likely to describe main effects and ‘‘z–y’’ (the variable in the legend) interactions when viewing bar graphs than when viewing line graphs. Familiarity of data presented and individuals’ graphicacy skills interacted with the inﬂuence of graph format. Speciﬁcally, viewers were most likely to generate inferences only when they had high graphicacy skills, the data were familiar and thus the information inferred was expected, and the format supported those inferences. Implications for multivariate data display are discussed.},

I guess higher dimensions are okay?

an increase in the apparent dimensionality of a graphical element is not necessarily associated with a concomitant decrease in the Stevens's law exponent
Elements with apparent dimensionalities greater than one were judged as though the elements possessed only one dimension, but they were judged more quickly than lower dimensional elements.

	abstract = {Graphical displays are frequently used to express quantitative information in texts, but viewers
are sometimes unable to comprehend and learn the relevant information. According to a
cognitive analysis, graph interpretation involves (a) relatively simple pattern perception and
association processes in which viewers can associate graphic patterns to quantitative referents
and (b) more complex and error-prone inferential processes in which viewers must mentally
transform data. Experiment 1 establishes that graphs can be redesigned to improve viewers'
interpretations by minimizing the inferential processes and maximizing the pattern association
processes required to interpret relevant information. In Experiments 2 and 3, the researchers
isolated one important factor that affects viewers' interpretation (i.e., the perceptual
organization of the information in graphs). If relevant quantitative information is perceptually
grouped to form visual chunks (because relevant data points are either connected in line graphs
or close together in bar graphs), then viewers describe relevant trends. If relevant information
is not perceptually grouped, viewers are less likely to comprehend relevant trends.},

We probed number-space mappings in the Mundurucu, an Amazonian indigene group with a reduced numerical lexicon and little or no formal education. At all ages, the Mundurucu mapped symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers onto a logarithmic scale, whereas Western adults used linear mapping with small or symbolic numbers and logarithmic mapping when numbers were presented nonsymbolically under conditions that discouraged counting. This indicates that the mapping of numbers onto space is a universal intuition and that this initial intuition of number is logarithmic. The concept of a linear number line appears to be a cultural invention that fails to develop in the absence of formal education.

We combine simple texture patternswith perceptually uniform colors to increasethe number of attribute values we can display simultaneously. Our technique builds multicolored perceptual texture elements (or pexels) to represent each data element. Attribute values encoded in an element are used to vary the appearance of its pexel. Texture and color patterns that form when the pexels are displayed can be used to rapidly and accurately explore the dataset. Our pexels are built by varying three separate texture dimensions: height, density, and regularity. Results from computer graphics, computer vision, and human visual psychophysics have identifiedthese dimensions as importantfor the formation of perceptualtexture patterns. The pexelsare colored using a selection technique that controls color distance, linear separation, and color category. Proper use of these criteria guarantees colors that are equally distinguishable from one another. We describe a set of controlled experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our texture dimensions and color selection criteria. We then discuss new work that studies how texture and color can be used simultaneously in a single display. Our results show that variations of height and density have no effect on color segmentation, but that random color patterns can interfere with texture segmentation. As the difficulty of the visual detection task increases, so too does the amount of color on texture interference increase. We conclude by demonstrating the applicability of our approach to a real-world problem, the tracking of typhoon conditions in Southeast Asia.},

transformation from table to graph

human information processing capabilities- the ability to recognize, classify, and remember visual patterns.


We do not know much about the perceptual, psychophysical, and cognitive processes that arc invoked during the examination of a graph.

We often rely on intuition to guide us in deciding whether a graph is good or bad, and we do not know how damaging "bad" graphs are.
because they are intended for an audience that is generally less expert than their author, presentation graphs necessarily tend to be simple in form and content


Pie Charts: Good vs Bad

For many years, the use of pie charts was frowned upon by statistical experts, based on psychophysical evidence (see Baird, 1970, for a review) that judgments of area, angle, and arc length are less accurate than judgments of length. Hence, the bar chart was favored.
A critical review of the existing evidence suggests that the prejudice against the pie chart is unfounded.
In spite of these results, modern commentators continue to advocate the bar chart in preference to the pie chart.


areas are systematically underestimated whereas line lengths are not.
Cleveland \& McGill

perceptual judgments of six basic stimuli were examined: (1) position along a common scale, (2) position along nonaligned scales, (3) length, (4) angle, (5) slope, and (6) area.


Spence (1989)

examined the speed and accuracy with which subjects judge the visual elements that make up pie charts, bar charts, and several variants, and also estimated the power function exponents for each element.
the addition of extra dimensions is not harmful, provided that base size remains constant.


Culbertson and Powers (1959)

a series of individual bars (either horizontally or vertically oriented) is superior to a line graph if specific quantities must be estimated.


Schutz (1961 b)

recommends that when several time series (in the experiment, he varied their number from two to four) are to be compared simultaneously, all variables should be shown as multiple lines in a single graph, rather than as individual lines in separate panels.


Paivio (1974)

summarizes several studies and concludes that there is at least a 10\% advantage in recall for pictures over words or sentences.
numerical information was better remembered when presented in a graph than when embedded in text.
By extension, if ways can be found to construct graphs that encourage and facilitate the formation of interacting images, memory for such graphs should be improved.


Tufte

advises maximizing the "data ink ratio"; that is, the ratio of printer's ink used for data to the ink used for other parts of the graph.
the graphs presented by Tufte as examples of good graphical practice are rather stark and minimalist. In ouropinion, people are more likely to be drawn to attractive, appealing graphs and, conversely, to be repelled by dry, sterile depictions of the data, devoid of even the slightest decoration. If a graph is not examined, it might as well not have been drawn. Moreover, we speculate that a decorated graph may be better remembered than a minimalist chart, anissue not considered by Tufte ( 1983).


Bobko and Karren (1979)

suggested that people's estimates are closer to the square of the correlation (r2) rather than to the correlation itself. Strahan



Cleveland and McGill ( 1984b)


advocate smoothing of scatterplots to assist in detecting the shape of the point cloud in situations where the error in the data is substantial, or where the density of points changes along the abscissa.



Multivariate displays are used to find clusters of related data points and to detect outlying or atypical points.

Use of Faces for symbols? Weird.

participants extrapolate data from a time series in a two-step process (Wagenaar \& Timmers,1978).

First, the properties of the time series are identified, e.g., whether the series is stationary, exhibits an increase or decrease, accelerates or decelerates.
After these properties are identified, participants use the rules they have discovered to predict future points.


discrimination is the first step in extrapolation, it is important to specify the ability of participants to discern among different functions.

Compared many factors:


exponential, asymptotic, and linear trends


increasing or decreasing


bar, suspended bar, scatter, and line plots


number of points


high, medium, low variability




Asked to identify the type of curve (exponential, asymptotic, linear; increasing, decreasing)


definition of exponential decreasing is … not what a mathematician would use. y=C+−ex instead of y=e−x. y=e−x is what they’ve defined as asymptotic decreasing.




n=6 with {\textasciitilde}2k trials per participant


hypothesis is 2-stage estimation: first, identify the type of curve and direction, then use that information for prediction


this experiment is examining whether discrimination between curve types is possible




accuracy higher when nonlinear trends presented (e.g. it’s hard to say something is linear, but easy to say that it isn’t)


accuracy higher with low variability – variability was additive, e.g. constant variance around mean function


it appears that participants examined curvature to make the determination of type


Takeaway: Use line/scatter plots


Takeaway 2: Increasing \# points helps with determination of linearity but doesn’t affect determination of nonlinearity


Takeaway 3: Accuracy ranged from 75\% to 50\% (ish) at determination of the type of curve. Any prediction errors would be on top of that.

Estimation Questions:

If nothing will stop this decreasing trend, (Group 1) what is your prediction for 1980?

The absolute magnitude of number does not affect the predictions in a systematic way.
Compared graphical and numerical estimation of decreasing exponential (y=e−xy=e−x) curves
Numerical estimation:

make a prediction for 1980
When will the process reach (y) (always targeted at 1980)



Graphical task: presented with an increasing and decreasing exponential series, which of the two series will reach y = … first?

I don’t fully understand the methods in this paper, particularly the graphical scale interlocking and rearrangement. It seems a bit insane.

Plotting exponential growth inversely reduces misperception – likely because the steepest part of the curve is shown early in the curve when participants are creating a heuristic for prediction.

Numerical estimation is more accurate than graphical estimation for exponential curves
Perceptual issue: ability to discriminate between values of ββ in functions y=expβxy=exp⁡βx
Aspect ratio of the graph didn’t significantly affect misperception
Instruction on exponential growth reduces underestimation, but doesn’t change issues with consistent underestimation of ββ - correction factor is the same across all problems. That is, participants increased estimates of y=αexpβxy=αexp⁡βx by increasing αα, not by changing ββ. Accuracy was still not as good using graphs as with numerical estimation

No correlation of accuracy with mathematical credit hours found (Experiment 1)

Takeaway: Using a log scale should make it much easier to estimate ββ - we estimate slopes relatively accurately (Mosteller et al. 1981), resolving much of the difficulty with exponential estimation
Takeaway 2: Direction of error (underestimation) is the same regardless of the question type asked:

Context matters!!!

experimental studies usually involve highly specific tasks carried out by particular types of subjects under a particular set of conditions.
variables:

forecasting environment, type of subject, information available to subjects, presence or absence of insentives




Goal: bring together research methods and limitations with practical implications
Tasks:

No context available

judgemental extrapolation of time series pattern into future
judgemental adjustment of statistical model's extrapolation


Context available

judgemental integration of time series \& contextual info in order to produce a forecast
judgemental adjustment of the forecast of a statistical model




Discussion Points:

processes, according to research, people use when applying judgement to forecasting tasks
evidence these processes can lead to systematically biased forecasts
effectiveness of particular strategies which are designed to improve the performance of the task


Heuristics and biases in time series extrapolation

anchoring (initial value from long term mean or previous value) and adjustment (adjust from anchor to obtain final forecast) F\_t+1 = Ybar + alpha(Y\_t = Ybar) == (1-alpha)Ybar + alphaY\_t


See tables 1 - 3 for review summaries of literature
Holt's model heuristic (three of them?)
Biases

Failure to identify correctly the nature of the underlying process
Failure to extrapolate this process accurately, even if it has been correctly identified


Problems:

Noise in the series masks the true signal.
People have a poor conception of randomness.


Does space allowed on a graph matter?
Do horizontal axis labels matter?
Number of points: underlying trend is important!

Larger the difference between observations two periods apart made the growth of the series more salient.
Think of this as we notice large differences when we are gone for a while verses if you are seeing the incremental changes.


Technical knowledge offers no advantage to the forecaster

Method of combination (ensemble methods?)

Logarithms convert multiplicative relationships to additive ones, providing an elegant way to span many orders of magnitude, to show elasticities and other proportional changes, and to linearize power laws.

They also have practical purposes, easing the computation of small numbers such as likelihoods and transforming data to fit statistical assumptions.


Questions:

How often do ecologists encounter log-scaled data?
How well do ecologists understand log-scaled data?


When presenting log-scaled data, it is possible to use either untransformed values (for example, values of 1, 10 and 100 are equally spaced along the axis) or log-transformed values (for example, 0, 1, and 2).
The main part of our survey presented respondents with graphs that were randomly displayed on linear–linear scales (Fig. 2a,d and g), log–log scales with untransformed values (Fig. 2b,e and h), or log–log scales with log-transformed values (Fig. 2c,f and i).

Two relationships were shown on each graph, with distance from the edge of a habitat on the horizontal axis and population size.

whether each population was increasing or decreasing with distance
how steeply the rabbit population changed with distance compared to the chipmunk population.!!!!

Misconception: ‘hand-hold fallacy’

Climbing something steep is harder than climbing something gradual, but climbing something smooth (such as a window) is harder than climbing something with hand-holds (such as a ladder), regardless of slope.




population level at the edge of the habitat.

Misconception: ‘Zeno’s zero fallacy’

Zeno’s famous paradox states that a distance can never be reduced to zero because it must be halved infinitely many times and it is impossible to perform an infinite number of tasks.




the manner in which a population changes.

3 Misconceptions: ‘watch out for curves fallacies’

all lines in log–log space are also lines in linear–linear space
all lines in log–log space curve upwards in linear–linear space
curves in log–log space have similar curvature in linear–linear space

We briefly introduce perceptual principles such as preattentive features and gestalt heuristics, and then discuss the design and results of a factorial experiment examining the effect of plot aesthetics such as color and trend lines on participants’ assessment of ambiguous data displays. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results strongly suggest that plot aesthetics have a significant impact on the perception of important features in data displays.
