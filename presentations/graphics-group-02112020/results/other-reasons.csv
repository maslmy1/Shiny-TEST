"Linear","Log"
"All fits on one clean curve","Break in data points"
"dispersion","less cluster"
"Fewer data points at high x-values so the evidence of the relationship for high x-values is weakest","No idea"
"Large variance in y-axis for small neighborhood in x-axis (near large x's)","spread"
"Least variability about line","up higher than the others"
"More scattered",
"Seems almost linear vs exponential",
